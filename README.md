# Sameer Poswal

Founding Engineer @[Referrush](https://www.referrush.com) · Full Stack Engineer · Open Source Contributor

I design and build production-grade systems with a focus on **scalability, reliability, and long-term maintainability**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **product engineering and infrastructure**, where developer experience, system performance, and business impact meet.

Currently working across **TypeScript**, **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Golang**, **WebRTC**, and cloud-native infrastructure.

## Engineering Philosophy

I optimize for:
- **Systems that scale with teams, not just traffic**
- **Codebases that remain readable after years, not months**
- **APIs that are explicit, predictable, and hard to misuse**
- **Infrastructure that balances cost, performance, and operational simplicity**

I believe strong engineering is about **making the right trade-offs visible** and not hiding complexity, but managing it deliberately.
